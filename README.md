# Strings
The String class is a standard
representation for a string of text. This class removes many of the problems introduced by C-style
strings by putting the responsibility of memory management on the String class rather than on the
programmer. The class should provide some typical string operations like comparison, concatenation,
random access to elements, length, etc.
